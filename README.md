# Dynamically Image Loader

The library allows you to dynamically load avatars (the Player Head) into the Minecraft Resource Pack.

> [!NOTE]
> The library depends on a resource pack that is not included in the library. You need to create a resource pack with the necessary textures and load it into the game.

## Installation

### Resource Pack

2. Add the necessary textures to the resource pack.



### Gradle Kotlin DSL
